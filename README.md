# Fake Job Description Prediction

## Task Goal
* Build a system to predict whether a JD is fake or not (Deep learning solution is better)

## Files
* [data_observation_splitting.ipynb](data_observation_splitting.ipynb) - data analysis and split data to training set and validation set
* [model_training_validation.ipynb](model_training_validation.ipynb) - build model and validation

## How to execute on Google colab
1. Do some prepare on your Google drive
    1. Create folder for dataset, splitted training data, validation data, model
    2. Create folder for testing data, if you want
2. Run ipynb file on Google colab
    1. Don't forget mount your drive on colab

## Questions:

1. Readme with the following question
    1. How to run your code?
    2. Write down what kind of ML solution will you use for this task.
    3. Why did you choose this solution?
    4. What is your modelâ€™s performance?
    5. Briefly describe what's the metrics will you use for the prediction model and why? What number will you set as the baseline?
2. Training model
    - All code you used for training your model (Include how you serialize the model)
